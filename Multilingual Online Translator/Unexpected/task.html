<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Okay, it seems like your program translates as expected. However, there’s a problem you should always keep in mind: something can break your program.</p>

<p>Up to this stage, you were thinking about things that should be in your code. But what if things go wrong? For example, you gave your program to someone who’s not familiar with the concept behind it. What if they try to translate to or from languages different from those you have in your code, or even start typing jabberwocky? That can break your program.</p>

<p>All these situations are called <strong>exceptions</strong> because you didn’t expect them to happen, and now you have to handle them.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>

<p>Notify users that they cannot translate to or from some languages.</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">&gt; python translator.py english korean hello
Sorry, the program doesn't support korean</code></pre>

<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>

<p>Check and notify if there’s a problem with the user’s internet connection.</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">&gt; python translator.py english all hello
Something wrong with your internet connection</code></pre>

<p><strong>Example 3</strong></p>

<p>Tell the user that you can’t translate jabberwocky.</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">&gt; python translator.py english all brrrrrrrrrrr
Sorry, unable to find brrrrrrrrrrr</code></pre>
